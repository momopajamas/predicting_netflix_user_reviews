    "In a time where Netflix faces serious competition from a variety of streaming services that have come up, able to leverage their affiliation with networks to claim a number of successful TV shows to boost their subscribers and libraries, Netflix has one competitive edge: the ease of usability and technical superiority. If Netflix wants to remain a serious competitor in the streaming business, it cannot falter in this crucial aspect, and must continually adjust its platforms and respond to the faults which can drive away consumers and subscribers. Additionally, we want to understand which aspects of our platform resonate positively with consumers, so that we have a better idea of how to go about marketing our product in relevant ways, as well as gaining deeper knowledge about which aspects of our product can be developed further to deepen our consumers' appreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are tasked with addressing this very issue: locating trends among negative user reviews so that we can adjust our product and continue to provide a top-tier streaming service that stands above the rest in technical terms, as well as trends among positive reviews so we can better understand which aspects of our product are best emphasized in our future marketing campaigns. We will particularly pay close attention to reviews produced over the past year or so, to ensure that our interventions are timely and relevant to the issues faced by our clientele in the currrent moment or very recent past. Focusing on recent reviews also provides clarity of action, as there is little point in us locating trends among negative reviews from a few years back that had already been addressed in the time since, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, we seek to gain a better understanding of the following:\n",
    "1. **Retention**, and why some users are unhappy with Netflix and may cancel their subscriptions.\n",
    "2. **Marketing Insights**, and identify what it is that people currently appreciate about Netflix so it can inform our promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this requires of us is:\n",
    "1. To build a **binary classification model** that can deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP), or more specifically, **Sentiment Analysis** on the user reviews, and use that insight to predict whether the review is positive or negative. This can be done through traditional supervised learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifiers, SVM, etc.\n",
    "2. Apply **clustering methods** to both groups of positive and negative reviews to identify trends and themes that will inform the actions we take.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we will be better equipped to provide solid business recommendations regarding subscriber retention as well as more effective marketing campaigns."
