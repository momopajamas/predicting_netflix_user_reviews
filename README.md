# Introduction
### Current State of Streaming
Though Netflix has long dominated the OTT market ("Over-the-Top", refering to the method of delivering content over the internet), the landscape of streaming services has drastically changed over the last few years, and with it, the challenges that Netflix faces. One of the most formidable of these challenges is the entry of legacy media companies, such as Disney and NBCUniversal, into the OTT market, as they are able to [leverage their deep content libraries to attract subscribers to their own services](https://www.filmtake.com/streaming/chasing-netflix-how-the-major-media-companies-stack-up-in-subscribers-revenue-and-challenges-part-one/).

According to [*Whip Media's 2023 US Streaming Satisfaction Survey*](https://whipmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-US-Streaming-Satisfaction-Study.pdf), there is persistent weakening trend among platform leaders, as Netflix "continues to decline in most measurements of satisfaction, while still holding on to the top rankings in the categories of user experience and programming recommendations."

A [*2023 piece by Variety surveying 40 Hollywood insiders*](https://variety.com/lists/user-friendly-streaming-services-survey/) about their experience using the numerous streaming platforms available to the public, or more specifically, "the way consumers interact with an app or website before, during and after they watch that content", found that "Netflix was most widely regarded as having the best UI [User Interface], with several comments about how intuitive and aesthetically pleasing the platform is." Another strength of Netflix's is its sophisticated recommendation system, sometimes refered to as ["digital nudging", which plays an important role in minimizing customer churn](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20438869241296895?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.1&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Another aspect that gives Netflix a competitive advantage over other streaming platforms is [the state of its global reach, as it currently operates in more than 190 countries](https://canvasbusinessmodel.com/blogs/competitors/netflix-competitive-landscape#:~:text=Global%20Reach:%20Netflix%20operates%20in,content%2C%20known%20as%20Netflix%20Originals.).

While other streaming services can leverage content exclusivity to attract subscribers, Netflix's library is not as deep or expansive, at least for the time being. However, Netflix's technical superiorty in UI and digital nudging gives it an indispensible competitive edge against its competitors, and must continually adjust its platforms and respond to the faults which can drive away consumers and subscribers.

# Business Understanding
Considering the strengths and weaknesses of Netflix outlined above, we need maintain our competitive edge against other streaming platforms by better understanding which aspects of our platform **frustrate our customers** and which aspects **resonate well with subscribers**.

We can do so by taking a look at reviews written over the past two years (2023-2025), to ensure that our insights are timely and relevant, as there is little point in working with older criticisms that may have already been addressed. 

Put another way, we seek insights pertaining to the following:
1. **Customer Retention**, and why some users are unhappy with Netflix and may cancel their subscriptions.
2. **Customer Acquisition**, and identify what it is that people currently appreciate about Netflix so it can inform our promotions and marketing.

What this requires of us is:

1. To build a **binary classification model** that can deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP), or more specifically, Sentiment Analysis on the user reviews, and use that insight to predict whether the review is positive or negative. This can be done through traditional supervised learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifiers, SVM, etc.
2. **Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation**, or `LDA`, to both groups of positive and negative reviews to identify trends and themes that will inform the actions we take.

In this way, we will be better equipped to provide solid business recommendations regarding subscriber retention as well as more effective marketing campaigns.
